# DAQEC (Digital Approximate Quantum Error Correction)

This project proposes a digital approximate quantum error correction (DAQEC) scheme tailored for correlated qubit errors. According to the correlated error formulism (especially among superconducting qubits) and popular probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) techniques, our approach integrated approximate error correction methods into error mitigation, which can deal with local errors and correlated errors in a scalable approach.
