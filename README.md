# Mosaic (A framework of quantum error mitigation for correlated noise)

This project proposes an implementatble noise-scope error mitigation scheme tailored for correlated qubit errors. According to the correlated error formulism (especially among superconducting qubits) and popular probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) techniques, our approach integrated approximate error correction methods into error mitigation, which can deal with local errors and correlated errors in a scalable approach.

*Our strategy is similar to the mosaic art, which is composed of small pieces of colored glass, stone, or other materials. Each piece is a small part of the whole picture, which is why we call our project "Mosaic".*
